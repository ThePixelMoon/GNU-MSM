an open-source recreation of My Singing Monsters made to popularize modding of it.
why? it's a great game, but it has the lack of community-made content.

used packages (linux):
libsdl2-dev
libsdl2-mixer-dev
libgles2-mesa-dev
libavif-dev
libpugixml-dev
libpng-dev

this project is not affiliated with big blue bubble (the original creators of my singing monsters) in any way.
this is all fanmade, and we do not promote hacks.
